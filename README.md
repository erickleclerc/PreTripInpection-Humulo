<h1 align="center"> Humulo VR - Pre-Trip Inspection </h1>

*** This is a copy from another repository with some packages removed. Core components are still intact. ***

## Vision
The Pre-Trip Inspection Training Module was developed for Humulo to explore solutions in VR training to improve the learning experience for prospective truck drivers. Offering this training through VR allows users to train at their own pace, without the need for a physical truck. Offsite allows for a risk-free and accessible training solution. Through hands-on interactive learning, users are taught procedures in a multimodal learning style â€” auditory, visual and tactile.  

The training module educates prospective commercial drivers with the essential tools for preparing a commercial vehicle for the road. A comprehensive inspection training experience designed to highlight the key aspects of vehicle maintenance, safety protocols, and regulatory compliance. Through interactive simulations and hands-on demonstrations, students will gain the expertise necessary to ensure their vehicle is in optimal condition, promoting safe and efficient journeys ahead.

## Major Deliverables
Deliverables for this project included a modular Unity project that can be used by the Humulo team for further research and development for their training products. Given the VFS team operated with Meta Quest 2 HMDs while Humulo uses Pico 4s, the project was developed with OpenXR. This would allow for the project to be adaptable to any standalone device system requirements. Through the design and development process, documentation of work was shared to communicate and discuss with the client. Users flows, personas, scenarios and storyboards were created iteratively to align Humulos goals within the capacity of the VFS team. Screen recordings of interactions, UI and narrative sections were shared to communicate Unity development. An APK was built for mobile on-device testing and feedback by Humulo.
